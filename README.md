# CISC352_Project
The course project for CISC 352 - Artificial Intelligence.

.zip files were .csv files that were too large to be pushed so they had to be compressed.

AIProject Draft Report.pdf has a list of all the files and what they are for but in terms of the project the important ones are:

csp_start and csp_testing: the constraints for the csp solver with varying outputs, I will probably do some team-specific constraints soon to lower some of the numbers.

deep_learning_start: the DL technique part, right now it is set to just output the predicted best and worst starting lineups from the season data in lineup_performance.csv, will likely be adjusting the output to be more in depth with not just starting lineups and more than just the top and bottom 5.

pddl files: just one problem file so far, thinking of doing roughly 5, right now just picks out a starting lineup but I will be incorporating making substitutions given certain situations such as wanting to prioritize defense/offense.

lots of python scripts are still here from the data preprocessing part of this.
